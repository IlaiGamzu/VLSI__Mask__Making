# VLSI__Mask__Making
This code describe the mask making process.
- First I make a mask with array (from numpy array) that consist from zeros and ones.
- Expose two defects in mask and how to fix it.
- The first defect is a "pin hole"- means in the process I put down too much chrom
- The second defect is a "Chrom spot"- means in the process I don't put dowm chrom that I should need to down from CAD patterns.
