# VLSI__Mask__Making
This code describes the mask making process.

# Create mask
- First I make a mask with an array (from numpy array) that consists of zeros and ones.
- Zero- means dark.
- One- means light.

# Expose two defects in the mask manufacturing process and how to fix it:

# Pin Hole
- The first defect is a "pin hole"- means in the process I put down too much chrom.

- To fix it, we reapet on the process and add a chrom when was a "Pin Hole" defect.

# Chrom spot
- The second defect is a "Chrom spot"- means in the process I don't put dowm chrom that I should need to down from CAD patterns.

- To fix it, we reaped on the process and removed a chrom when it was a "Chrom spot" defect.

# Note
The defects in this code are in a random state.
